          <h3>We are esports fan</h3>
          <p>
            Before being the creator of this website, I am an esport fan.
          </p>
          <p>I've always wanted to know my teams next match and it's really hard to do. The easiest way to do was to track them down on Twitter but this is not really the best experience at all.</p>
          <p>
            Eventually I've come across a public Google calendar and I finally found a way. With esports-calendar I've created a solution for everyone to create or to follow their favorite teams events.
          </p>
          <p>
            For team: This is the next level to give your fans your intel without too much effort. Share or create a Google Calendar, then you can create your own page calendar on this website. Share it with the world!
          </p>
          <p>
            For fans: Get your team a dedicated page with the calendar of all the events. If they don't provide one, you can also create one if you are aware of their every moves! Get help from other fans.
